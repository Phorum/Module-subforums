Module  : Subforums
Version : 1.0.1
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module implements a simple subforums system for Phorum.


Features:
---------

- On the index page, subforums will be listed as simple links below each forum
  that has subforums;

- Formatting of these subforum links is based on a template, so it is
  possible to modify this list to your needs (e.g. by creating a vertical
  subforum list instead of using the default horizontal one);

- On the message list page, details for the available subforums are listed
  at the top of the page;

- When marking a forum as read on the index page, then its subforums will
  automatically be marked read as well; 

- The breadcrumbs will be modified to represent the subforum structure.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive and move the directory "subforums" to the directory
  "mods" within your Phorum installation (unless this module was packaged
  with your Phorum release);

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Subforums".

- Structure the forums and folders to match this module's requirements.
  See below for a description.


How to organize your forums and folders:
----------------------------------------

This module is based on top of the flat index page structure, where the index
page contains one or more categories and where forums are placed in these
categories. This module expects the following folder/forum stucture:

* First level folders are represented as categories on the index page

* Second level folders are used for grouping a forum and its subforums. This
  folder level is not shown on the index page.

* Inside the second level folder, the first forum is used as the forum to
  display on the index page as the main forum. The second forum and up
  are displayed as subforums for the main forum.

* Forums that do not have subforums can be added to a category folder as usual.


Here is an example tree view for this structure:

  Root
  |
  +--- Folder (category 1)
  |    |    
  |    +--- Folder
  |    |    |
  |    |    +--- Forum (forum 1)
  |    |    | 
  |    |    +--- Forum (subforum 1.1)
  |    |    |
  |    |    +--- Forum (subforum 1.2)
  |    |
  |    +--- Folder
  |         |
  |         +--- Forum (forum 2)
  |         |
  |         +--- Forum (subforum 2.1)
  |
  +--- Folder (category 2)
       |    
       +--- Folder
       |    |
       |    +--- Forum (forum 3)
       |    | 
       |    +--- Forum (subforum 3.1)
       |    |
       |    +--- Forum (subforum 3.2)
       |    |
       |    +--- Forum (subforum 3.3)
       |
       +--- Forum (forum 4, without subforums)


Using this tree structure, the index page will look (somewhat ;-) like this:


  Category 1 ===========================================

  Forum 1
  Subforums: subforum 1.1, subforum 1.2

  ------------------------------------------------------

  Forum 2
  Subforum: subforum 2.1

  Category 2 ===========================================

  Forum 3
  Subforums: subforum 3.1, subforum 3.2, subforum 3.3

  ------------------------------------------------------

  Forum 4

  ------------------------------------------------------


Language support:
-----------------

This module supports multiple languages. If you want to translate the module
to a new language, you'll have to do the following:

Copy lang/english.php to lang/yourlang.php (yourlang.php must have the
same name as Phorum's main language file that you use). After this,
translate the strings in lang/yourlang.php.

If you have created a translation for this module, please post the script
lang/yourlang.php in the thread for this module, so we can add the
translation to the module distribution.
